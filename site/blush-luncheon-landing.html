		<p>The GW Mobile Mammography Program&mdash;The Mammovan&mdash;began in 1996 with a singular, ambitious
		goal: to make life-saving, early detection of breast cancer possible for all women throughout the
		metropolitan Washington, D.C. area, regardless of their ability to pay. A key goal of the program is to
		aid in early detection to ensure the best possible health outcomes for women identified as having breast
		cancer. This self-contained mobile unit travels to corporate and community sites and provides breast
		cancer screening to more than 2,500 women annually in a comfortable, convenient environment.</p>

		<p>The Mammovan helps to break down both access and time constraint barriers by reaching women
		where they live and work, including underserved communities without existing facilities. The
		Mammovan provides state-of-the-art screenings (including digital mammography) at 160 sites
		throughout the D.C. region.</p>

		<p>The Mammovan's work is made possible by the generous support of corporate, foundation, and
		individual donors who share in the programâ€™s mission to both prevent and provide early detection for
		breast cancer.<p>
